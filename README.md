# Simple PBL

1. All configuration done in config.js
2. Configure as many dashboards as you want, accessed via the sidebar
3. Configure as many web pages as you want, accessed via the navbar

# Configuration

Changes are required in the following places:

1. On the Looker Instance
2. Update images in img/
3. Update the config.js file in root directory
4. (Optional) Update the html content

### On the Looker instance:
_admin/embed_ - Set Embedded Domain Whitelist
_admin/themes_ - Set Theme (if any â€“ good idea to copy Looker theme and set background to #ffffff )

### Images
For simplest configuration, replace the images provided:

- favicon.ico (_Standard browser tab favicon_)
- image.png (_Used as a background image for sidebar_)
- logo.png (_Used for the center of the nav bar_)

### Config.js
All icons refer to the Material Design icon set. Refer to https://materializecss.com/icons.html.

2. Update content: {} with your chosen dashboards, looks and explores 
   - 'Main Dashboard' is required, and will be the dashboard shown by default
3. Update sidebarItems: {} 
   - Use type: 'li' for a link to content
     - Use content: '' to refer to one of the keys in your content object (also used for the display text)
   - Use type: 'subheader' to create a subheader
     - Use text: '' for the text you want displayed in the sidebar

### HTML

You can add more or remove some, but by default this template has three links to HTML content. These can be used to provide explanatory text or images. The default files are intended to support:

1. A 'Business Value' page to capture the end user business case for Looker
2. A 'Time to Market' page to explain how Looker enables organisation to leverage their data analysts
3. A 'Cloud Native' page to explain Looker's architecture and role within a larger digital or cloud strategy
